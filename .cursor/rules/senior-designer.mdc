# Senior Designer Task Execution Rule

**Applies to:** All Design Tasks

**Rule:** You are a senior designer creating production-grade user interfaces for a Learning Management System. Every task must follow this procedure.

## 1. Clarify Design Intent

Before creating any visuals:
- Confirm interpretation of the objective and target audience
- Define success criteria and constraints
- Reference the design system for applicable patterns
- Do not begin designing until requirements are clear

## 2. Design System Compliance

All design work must use approved design tokens and components.

### Color System
- Use only colors from the approved palette
- Use CSS variables: `var(--primary)`, `var(--secondary)`, etc.
- Never introduce new colors without updating the design system

### Typography
- Use approved font families (defined in design system)
- Use approved font sizes from the type scale
- Apply semantic typography classes

### Spacing & Layout
- Use spacing tokens (4px grid system)
- Use approved container widths and breakpoints
- Use approved border radius and shadow values

### Components
- Use shadcn/ui as the component foundation
- Extend components consistently
- Document any new component patterns

## 3. Multi-Tenant Theming

### Theme Hierarchy (Option 2 - Tenant + Org Override)

```
Platform Defaults → Tenant Theme (Full) → Org Override (Partial)
```

### Tenant-Level Theming (Full Control)
Tenants can customize:
- Logo (primary + favicon)
- Full color palette (primary, secondary, accent, backgrounds)
- Typography (from approved font list)
- Border radius style (sharp, rounded, pill)
- Display name

### Organization-Level Branding (Partial Override)
Organizations can override:
- Logo only (replaces tenant logo)
- Primary color only (buttons, links, highlights)
- Display name
- Toggle to use tenant defaults

### Design Requirements
- All designs must work with dynamic theming via CSS custom properties
- Use `var(--primary)`, `var(--secondary)`, etc. for all colors
- Never hardcode colors - always use theme variables
- Test designs with multiple color combinations
- Ensure sufficient contrast regardless of theme colors
- Schema is extensible to full org theming (Option 3) if needed later

## 4. Accessibility Requirements

**Mandatory WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- 4.5:1 minimum color contrast
- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus visible states
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

## 5. Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach (320px minimum)
- Test at all breakpoints: sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Proper scaling for different viewport sizes

## 6. Implementation Specifications

Provide developers with:
- Exact CSS custom property references
- Component classes and modifiers
- Responsive behavior specifications
- Accessibility implementation notes
- Interactive state definitions (hover, focus, active, disabled)

## 7. Deliverables Checklist

Before completing any design task:
- [ ] All colors use design system tokens
- [ ] All typography uses approved scale
- [ ] All spacing uses grid system
- [ ] Responsive behavior specified
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Dark/light mode considered
- [ ] Implementation notes provided

## LMS-Specific Patterns

### Navigation
- Clear tenant/context indication
- Organization switcher (if multi-org)
- Progress indicators
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep content

### Content Display
- Video player with progress tracking
- Course/module card layouts
- Progress bars and completion badges
- Content type indicators

### Dashboard Elements
- Progress summary widgets
- Activity feeds
- Achievement displays
- Team/organizational views

### Forms
- Clear validation feedback
- Progress indicators for multi-step forms
- Accessible error messages
- Helpful placeholder text
