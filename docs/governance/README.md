# Governance Documentation

This section contains cross-team rules, standards, and guidelines that ensure consistency and quality across the LeaderForge platform.

## Contents

### Standards & Guidelines

#### [Universal Glossary](universal-glossary.md)
Single source of truth for all domain terminology used across the platform. Essential for maintaining consistency in documentation, code, and communication.

**Key concepts:** Tenant, Module, Widget, Composition, Agent, Tool, etc.

#### [Cursor Rules Reference](cursor-rules-reference.md)
Complete reference to all Cursor AI development rules, organized by persona for automated quality assurance during development.

**Available rules:** Senior Architect, Senior Engineer, Product Manager, QA, Designer rules

### Automated Development Rules

The core development standards are enforced automatically through Cursor AI rules located in `.cursor/rules/`:

- **senior-architect-rule.mdc** - Architectural integrity and system design
- **senior-engineer-rule.mdc** - Implementation standards and technical patterns
- **senior-product-manager-rule.mdc** - Product strategy and user experience
- **senior-qa-rule.mdc** - Testing methodology and quality gates
- **senior-qa-rule-documentation.mdc** - Documentation quality and maintenance
- **senior-designer-rule.mdc** - Design system and UI standards

## How to Use This Section

1. **Universal Glossary** - Check terminology before using domain-specific terms
2. **Cursor Rules** - Understand available automated development assistance
3. **Cross-reference** - Ensure alignment between rules and glossary

## Recent Updates

- **Consolidated Cursor Rules** - Moved from technology-specific to persona-based organization for better clarity and reduced duplication
- **Enhanced Universal Glossary** - Complete terminology standardization across all domains
- **Improved Documentation Standards** - Clear guidelines for documentation quality and maintenance

## Overview

This section contains the fundamental rules, standards, and governance frameworks that apply across all teams and roles at LeaderForge. These documents establish the foundation for consistent, high-quality development practices.

## Team Rules & Standards

### Core Team Rules
- **[Cursor Rules Reference](cursor-rules-reference.md)** - Complete guide to development rules enforced by Cursor AI

**Note**: Senior role rules have been moved to `.cursor/rules/` directory so Cursor automatically enforces them during development. See the reference above for complete details.

### Cross-Team Standards
- **[Universal Glossary](universal-glossary.md)** - Single source of truth for all terminology
- **[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)** - Professional behavior and collaboration standards
- **[Documentation Standards](documentation-standards.md)** - File headers, naming conventions, maintenance
- **[Security Guidelines](security-guidelines.md)** - Security practices and requirements
- **[Performance Standards](performance-standards.md)** - Performance requirements and optimization

## Governance Framework

### Decision Making
- **Architecture Decisions**: Must follow Senior Architect Rule with ADR documentation
- **Product Decisions**: Must follow Senior Product Manager Rule with PRD documentation
- **Technical Decisions**: Must follow Senior Engineer Rule with clear implementation plans
- **Quality Decisions**: Must follow Senior QA Rule with comprehensive testing strategies

### Escalation Process
1. **Team Level**: Discuss within relevant team first
2. **Cross-Team**: Escalate to appropriate senior role (architect, PM, engineer, QA)
3. **Leadership**: Escalate to leadership for business-critical decisions
4. **Documentation**: All decisions must be documented in appropriate format (ADR, PRD, etc.)

### Review Cycles
- **Quarterly**: Review all governance documents for effectiveness
- **Semi-Annual**: Update team rules based on lessons learned
- **Annual**: Comprehensive governance framework review

## Compliance

### Mandatory Compliance
- All team members must read and acknowledge governance documents
- All projects must follow established rules and standards

### Monitoring
- **Code Reviews**: Check compliance with engineering and architecture standards
- **Sprint Reviews**: Verify adherence to product management and QA standards
- **Architecture Reviews**: Ensure alignment with architectural governance
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks for documentation and code standards

### Enforcement
- **Training**: Provide training for governance compliance
- **Mentoring**: Pair new team members with governance-aware mentors
- **Feedback**: Regular feedback on governance adherence
- **Escalation**: Clear escalation path for governance violations
