## Enhancement Backlog

### 1. Feature-level or Content-level Entitlement

- **Description:**
  - Implement fine-grained access control for specific features (e.g., analytics, chat) or individual content/media items (e.g., videos, courses) within a context.
- **Status:**
  - Not started. Tracked for future design and implementation.
- **Notes:**
  - Would require new tables (e.g., `context_feature_access_policies`, `content_access_policies`) and supporting functions.
  - Should be designed to work alongside context-level entitlement.
