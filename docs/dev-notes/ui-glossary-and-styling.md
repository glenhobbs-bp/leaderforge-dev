UI Glossary and Styling Reference Guide

This document defines the terminology, architecture, styling conventions, and configuration model for the 3-panel layout used in the LeaderForge platform. It is designed to support consistent, context-specific branding and UI composition while providing a clear separation of concerns for development and future extensibility.

Layout & Architecture

The UI is composed of a 3-panel layout:

1. NavPanel (Left)
   • Shows Context branding (logo, icon).
   • Displays sections for navigation.
   • Supports collapse/expand behavior.
   • Collapsed state shows icons only (fallback icon or alternate defined per Context).

2. ContentPanel (Center)
   • Displays main application content based on selected section.

3. ChatPanel (Right)
   • Hosts the contextual AI Assistant.

These panels are composed using the ThreePanelLayout.tsx component.

Separation of Concerns

Layer Role
Layout Core structure of UI (ThreePanelLayout). Fixed platform-wide.
Panel Styling Shared styling per panel (e.g., margins, fonts, spacing, etc).
Context Theme Configurable design tokens per Context (colors, gradient, etc).
Context Structure Nav options, titles, logos defined in JSON or Supabase.
Dynamic Content Fetched/generated by the platform, varies per user interaction.

Panel Sizing (Desktop)

Panel Width (px) Notes
NavPanel 280 Collapsible to ~80px (icon only)
ContentPanel auto Flexible
ChatPanel 360 Fixed width

• NavPanel becomes slide-in or icon-only.
• ContentPanel remains central.
• Controlled via Tailwind md: and lg: breakpoints.

Appendix E — Localization Support

To support multiple languages: 1. Text Keys Instead of Raw Strings

{
"label": "nav.dashboard.label",
"description": "nav.dashboard.description"
}

    2.	Localization JSON Files

// en.json
{
"nav": {
"dashboard": {
"label": "Dashboard",
"description": "Quick access to activity"
}
}
}

    3.	Detection & Loading
    •	Language is auto-detected or selected via UI.
    •	Texts resolved via i18n library (e.g., next-intl, i18next).
    4.	Storage
    •	Default fallback in code.
    •	Overrides fetched from Supabase.
