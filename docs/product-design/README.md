## Overview

This section contains all product design documentation including the design system, UX patterns, visual standards, and design processes. Our design approach is agent-native with context-aware theming and accessibility-first principles.

## Structure

### ðŸŽ¨ [Design System](design-system.md) - Complete Visual Design System
Comprehensive design system specification including:
- **Foundation** - Core principles, design tokens structure
- **Color System** - Base palette, semantic colors, context-specific themes
- **Typography** - Font families, scales, component styles
- **Widget Library** - Button, card, input, navigation widgets
- **Tenant Branding** - LeaderForge and Brilliant Movement visual identity
- **Implementation Guidelines** - CSS usage, accessibility standards

### ðŸ§© [Widget Patterns](widget-patterns/) - Reusable UI Patterns
Common widget patterns and composition guidelines:
- **Layout Patterns** - Grid systems, spacing, responsive behavior
- **Interaction Patterns** - Hover states, focus management, animations
- **Data Display** - Tables, lists, cards, media presentation
- **Form Patterns** - Input validation, multi-step forms, accessibility

### ðŸŽ¯ [UX Patterns](ux-patterns/) - User Experience Guidelines
User experience patterns and best practices:
- **Navigation Design** - NavPanel and ContentPanel layout, tenant switching
- **Conversation Design** - Chat interface, agent interaction patterns
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, screen readers
- **Mobile Design** - Responsive behavior, touch interactions

### ðŸŽ­ [Tenant Theming](tenant-theming/) - Multi-Tenant Design
Guidelines for designing across multiple tenants:
- **Tenant Differentiation** - Visual identity separation between LeaderForge and Brilliant
- **Theme Switching** - Smooth transitions between tenant themes
- **Brand Guidelines** - Logo usage, color application, typography hierarchy
- **Consistency Standards** - Maintaining usability across different visual themes

### ðŸ”¬ [Design Research](design-research/) - User Research & Testing
User research, testing, and design validation:
- **User Personas** - Target user archetypes and their needs
- **Usability Studies** - Testing results and design iterations
- **Design Validation** - A/B testing, user feedback, metrics
- **Accessibility Testing** - Screen reader testing, keyboard navigation validation

## Design Principles

### Agent-Native Design
- **Schema-Driven Rendering** - Widgets render based on agent-provided schemas
- **Dynamic Composition** - Agents compose UI layouts from available widgets
- **Tenant Awareness** - Design adapts to current tenant (LeaderForge vs Brilliant)
- **Conversation-First** - All functionality accessible through natural language

### Accessibility First
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance** - Meet or exceed accessibility standards
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Full functionality without mouse
- **Screen Reader Support** - Comprehensive ARIA labeling and structure
- **Color Contrast** - Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for text

### Performance Optimized
- **Minimal Bundle Size** - Efficient widget loading and tree-shaking
- **Smooth Animations** - 60fps animations with hardware acceleration
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality without JavaScript
- **Mobile-First** - Optimized for mobile performance and constraints

### Tenant Flexibility
- **Multi-Tenant Support** - Seamless experience across LeaderForge and Brilliant
- **Theme Consistency** - Maintain usability while adapting visual identity
- **Brand Differentiation** - Clear visual distinction between tenants
- **User Preference** - Respect user accessibility and preference settings

## Design Process

### Design Workflow
1. **User Research** - Understand user needs and pain points
2. **Concept Design** - Create initial design concepts and wireframes
3. **Design System** - Apply design system patterns and tokens
4. **Prototyping** - Create interactive prototypes for testing
5. **Usability Testing** - Validate designs with target users
6. **Implementation** - Work with engineering for pixel-perfect implementation
7. **Design QA** - Review implemented designs for accuracy
8. **Iteration** - Refine based on user feedback and metrics

### Design Review Process
- **Peer Review** - Design team reviews for consistency and quality
- **Accessibility Review** - Validate accessibility compliance
- **Engineering Review** - Ensure implementation feasibility
- **Product Review** - Align with product requirements and business goals
- **User Testing** - Validate with actual users before implementation

### Design Documentation
- **Design Specs** - Detailed specifications for implementation
- **Component Documentation** - Widget usage guidelines and examples
- **Pattern Library** - Reusable design patterns and when to use them
- **Design Decisions** - Rationale for design choices and trade-offs

## Tools & Resources

### Design Tools
- **Figma** - Primary design tool for UI design and prototyping
- **Design System** - Figma component library with all widgets and patterns
- **Color Tools** - Contrast checkers and color palette generators
- **Typography Tools** - Font pairing and hierarchy validation

### Testing Tools
- **Accessibility Testing** - Screen readers, keyboard navigation testing
- **Usability Testing** - User testing platforms and session recording
- **Performance Testing** - Core web vitals and mobile performance testing
- **Cross-Browser Testing** - Ensure consistency across browsers and devices

### Collaboration
- **Design Handoff** - Figma to development workflow
- **Design Reviews** - Regular review sessions with cross-functional teams
- **User Feedback** - Channels for collecting and processing user feedback
- **Design System Maintenance** - Process for evolving and updating design standards

## Tenant Considerations

### LeaderForge Tenant
- **Professional** - Clean, authoritative, trustworthy visual identity
- **Growth-Oriented** - Forward-thinking, progressive design language
- **Empowering** - Confident, enabling, supportive user experience
- **Modern** - Contemporary, innovative, efficient interaction patterns

### Brilliant Movement Tenant
- **Authentic** - Genuine, real, honest visual and interaction design
- **Community-Focused** - Collaborative, inclusive, supportive experience
- **Spiritual** - Meaningful, purposeful, transformative user journey
- **Warm** - Welcoming, nurturing, caring visual identity

### Design Consistency
- **Functional Consistency** - Same interaction patterns across contexts
- **Visual Differentiation** - Distinct visual identity per tenant
- **Accessibility Parity** - Equal accessibility across all tenants
- **Performance Equality** - Consistent performance regardless of tenant

## Getting Started

### For Designers
1. Review the [design system](design-system.md) for current standards
2. Understand [tenant theming](tenant-theming/) for multi-tenant design
3. Familiarize yourself with [UX patterns](ux-patterns/) and best practices
4. Review [accessibility guidelines](ux-patterns/accessibility.md) for inclusive design

### For Engineers
1. Study the [design system](design-system.md) for implementation guidance
2. Review [widget patterns](widget-patterns/) for component development
3. Understand [tenant theming](tenant-theming/) for dynamic styling
4. Check [accessibility requirements](ux-patterns/accessibility.md) for compliance

### For Product Managers
1. Understand [design principles](#design-principles) that guide decisions
2. Review [design process](#design-process) for timeline planning
3. Study [tenant considerations](#tenant-considerations) for feature planning
4. Review [design research](design-research/) for user insights

**Note on Terminology**: We use "Tenant" to refer to branded deployment variants (LeaderForge, Brilliant Movement). "Module" refers specifically to training modules (collections of videos and guides).

**Remember**: Great design is invisible - it enables users to accomplish their goals effortlessly while feeling confident and supported throughout their journey.
