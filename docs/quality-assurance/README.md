## QA Audit System

### Audit Numbering Convention

QA audits follow the same numbering pattern as ADRs:
- **Format:** `QA-XXXX-descriptive-name.md`
- **Example:** `QA-0001-navigation-state-restoration-audit.md`
- **Sequence:** Incremental, starting from QA-0001

### Audit Lifecycle

1. **Active Audit** (`audits/`)
   - QA assessment identifies issues
   - Document created with findings and required actions
   - Status tracked until resolution

2. **Resolution Process**
   - Engineering team addresses identified issues
   - QA re-validates fixes
   - Status updated in audit document

3. **Resolved Audit** (`resolved/`)
   - All critical issues resolved
   - Final verification completed
   - Document moved to resolved folder
   - Resolution date and final status recorded

### Audit Status Levels

- 🟢 **PASS** - No issues, ready for deployment
- 🟡 **CONDITIONAL PASS** - Minor issues, deployment acceptable with conditions
- ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL PASS WITH BLOCKERS** - Critical issues identified, deployment blocked
- 🔴 **FAIL** - Major failures, requires significant remediation

### Issue Severity Classification

- 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Production blockers, security vulnerabilities, data loss risks
- 🟡 **HIGH** - Performance issues, architectural violations, compatibility risks
- 🟠 **MEDIUM** - Code quality issues, minor bugs, technical debt
- 🟢 **LOW** - Documentation gaps, cosmetic issues, minor improvements

## Current Active Audits

### QA-0001: Navigation State Restoration Audit
- **Status:** 🟡 CONDITIONAL PASS WITH CRITICAL BLOCKERS
- **Critical Issues:** EventEmitter memory leak, Agent context inconsistency
- **Deployment Status:** ❌ BLOCKED

## QA Process Integration

### When to Create QA Audits

1. **Feature Completion** - Before marking any feature as "done"
2. **Pre-Deployment** - Mandatory QA audit before production releases
3. **Architecture Changes** - When modifying core architectural patterns
4. **Performance Concerns** - When performance issues are suspected
5. **Security Updates** - For any security-related changes
6. **User-Reported Issues** - For systematic investigation of user problems

### QA Audit Template

Each audit should include:

1. **Header Information**
   - Date, Auditor, Status, Feature/Component
2. **Executive Summary**
   - High-level findings and recommendations
3. **Audit Scope**
   - What was tested, environment, user context
4. **Test Results**
   - Passed functionality, failed items, critical issues
5. **Performance Analysis**
   - Metrics, benchmarks, bottlenecks
6. **Architectural Compliance**
   - Adherence to established patterns and principles
7. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - Dead code, logic issues, error handling
8. **Security Assessment**
   - Authentication, authorization, data protection
9. **Production Readiness**
   - Quality gates, deployment readiness
10. **Required Actions**
    - Critical fixes, timeline, ownership
11. **Test Evidence**
    - Logs, screenshots, metrics
12. **Recommendations**
    - Immediate, short-term, long-term actions
13. **Sign-Off**
    - Final assessment and deployment recommendation

### Integration with Development Workflow

1. **Engineering** implements feature
2. **QA** creates audit document in `audits/`
3. **Engineering** addresses critical issues
4. **QA** re-validates and updates audit
5. **QA** moves resolved audit to `resolved/`
6. **Engineering** can proceed with deployment

### Audit Review Process

- **Daily:** Review active audits for status updates
- **Weekly:** Audit team reviews all open issues
- **Monthly:** Analysis of audit trends and process improvements
- **Quarterly:** Review resolved audits for pattern analysis

## Quality Gates

### Deployment Blockers

Any audit with these findings blocks deployment:
- 🔴 Critical security vulnerabilities
- 🔴 Data loss or corruption risks
- 🔴 Memory leaks or performance degradation
- 🔴 Architectural compliance failures
- 🔴 Authentication/authorization bypasses

### Quality Metrics

Track these metrics across audits:
- **Time to Resolution** - How quickly issues are fixed
- **Issue Recurrence** - Whether similar issues repeat
- **Audit Coverage** - Percentage of features audited
- **Critical Issue Rate** - Frequency of deployment blockers

## Best Practices

1. **Be Thorough** - Test beyond happy paths
2. **Document Everything** - Evidence-based findings
3. **Think Production** - Consider real-world usage scenarios
4. **Challenge Assumptions** - Question "it works on my machine"
5. **Adversarial Testing** - Try to break the system
6. **Performance Focus** - Always measure, never assume
7. **Security Mindset** - Consider attack vectors and edge cases

## Tools and Resources

- **Session Monitoring:** `./monitor-sessions.sh`
- **Environment Cleanup:** `./cleanup-sessions.sh`
- **Performance Testing:** Browser DevTools, Lighthouse
- **Memory Analysis:** Node.js profiling tools
- **Security Scanning:** Dependency audits, static analysis

**Remember:** QA is the final line of defense before production. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and thorough investigation.
