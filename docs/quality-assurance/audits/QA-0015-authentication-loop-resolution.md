# QA Audit #0015: Authentication Loop Resolution

**Audit ID:** QA-0015
**Date:** January 17, 2025
**Severity:** HIGH (Authentication System Malfunction)
**Status:** RESOLVED ✅
**Reporter:** User
**Assignee:** Engineering Team

## Issue Summary

**Authentication loop issue**: After implementing security fixes for browser storage, users experienced authentication loops where the system repeatedly tried to authenticate with expired/invalid tokens, causing infinite redirect cycles between dashboard and login pages.

### Symptoms Observed
- **Browser logs**: Continuous POST requests to `/api/agent/context` returning 401 errors
- **Server logs**: `Session restoration failed: Auth session missing!` repeated constantly
- **User experience**: Unable to access dashboard, stuck in login/redirect loop
- **Middleware behavior**: Found tokens (918 chars) but session restoration failed

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Issue: Expired Token Persistence
```
[MIDDLEWARE] ✅ Valid tokens found for /dashboard - allowing access
[restoreSession] Session restoration failed: Auth session missing!
[dashboard/page] No user found in session, redirecting to login
```

The middleware was detecting cookies with tokens, but the tokens were **expired/invalid**, causing:
1. **Middleware** passed requests (found tokens)
2. **Server-side session restoration** failed (tokens invalid)
3. **Pages** redirected to login
4. **Process repeated** infinitely

#### Secondary Issue: No Token Cleanup
When tokens expired, the system didn't clear them, causing the middleware to continue finding "valid" tokens that were actually invalid, perpetuating the loop.

## Resolution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Token Validation ✅
**File:** `apps/web/app/lib/supabaseServerClient.ts`

```typescript
export async function restoreSession(cookieStore: ReadonlyRequestCookies, setCookies?: (cookies: { name: string, value: string, options: unknown }[]) => void) {
  // ... token checks ...

  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

    if (error) {
      // LOOP PREVENTION: Clear invalid tokens
      if (error.message.includes('refresh_token_not_found') ||
          error.message.includes('invalid_grant') ||
          error.message.includes('Auth session missing')) {
        console.log('[restoreSession] Clearing invalid tokens to prevent auth loop');

        if (setCookies) {
          setCookies([
            { name: 'sb-access-token', value: '', options: { maxAge: 0 } },
            { name: 'sb-refresh-token', value: '', options: { maxAge: 0 } }
          ]);
        }
      }
      return { session: null, supabase, error };
    }
    // ... success handling ...
  }
}
```

### 2. Cookie Cleanup Endpoint ✅
**File:** `apps/web/app/api/auth/clear-session/route.ts`

Created dedicated endpoint to break authentication loops:
```typescript
export async function POST() {
  const response = NextResponse.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'Authentication cookies cleared'
  });

  // Clear all authentication-related cookies
  response.cookies.set('sb-access-token', '', {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    sameSite: 'lax',
    maxAge: 0,
    path: '/'
  });
  // ... same for refresh token ...
}
```

### 3. Context Preferences Simplification ✅
**File:** `apps/web/app/context/preferences/ContextPreferencesClient.tsx`

Temporarily simplified to avoid module resolution issues during debugging:
- Removed `UniversalSchemaRenderer` import that was causing build errors
- Added simple placeholder interface
- Maintained server-side authentication protection

## Verification Results

### Pre-Fix (BROKEN) ❌
```
✗ Infinite login/dashboard redirect loops
✗ Browser console flooded with 401 errors
✗ Server logs showing continuous auth failures
✗ User unable to access application
```

### Post-Fix (WORKING) ✅
```
✓ Clean redirect from dashboard → login when unauthenticated
✓ No authentication loops or repeated errors
✓ Clear session endpoint working: curl -X POST /api/auth/clear-session
✓ Context preferences page loads with placeholder content
✓ Module resolution issues resolved
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test clean unauthenticated redirect
curl -I http://localhost:3000/dashboard
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect, location: /login

# Clear stuck authentication state
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/clear-session
# Expected: {"success":true,"message":"Authentication cookies cleared"}

# Verify no cookies remain
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/debug/cookies | jq '.cookies'
# Expected: []
```

## Impact Assessment

- **Severity:** HIGH - System completely unusable for affected users
- **User Impact:** Authentication completely broken, no access to application
- **Duration:** Temporary (resolved within development session)
- **Root Cause:** Security hardening inadvertently created token validation gap

## Prevention Measures

1. **Token Lifecycle Management**: All auth token operations must include cleanup on failure
2. **Loop Detection**: Authentication flows must detect and break infinite loops
3. **Better Error Handling**: Invalid tokens should be cleared immediately, not persisted
4. **Testing Protocol**: All auth changes must be tested with expired/invalid token scenarios

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Restore full `PromptContextWidget` functionality to context preferences page
- [ ] Implement automated auth loop detection in monitoring
- [ ] Add client-side auth state cleanup to complement server-side fixes
- [ ] Create integration tests for auth loop scenarios

**Resolution Confirmed:** ✅ Authentication loop completely resolved. System now properly handles expired tokens and prevents infinite redirect cycles.
