# Product Requirements Document: Agent-Native Composition System

**File:** docs/prd-agent-native-composition-system.md
**Purpose:** Comprehensive product requirements for agent-native UI composition system
**Owner:** Senior Product Manager
**Tags:** PRD, agent-native, composition, components, user-experience

## Executive Summary

### Vision
Transform LeaderForge into a truly agent-native application where users can discover, interact with, and customize their learning experience through natural conversation, with AI agents dynamically composing optimal user interfaces from modular components.

### Core User Problem
Current UI is static and cannot adapt to individual user needs, learning styles, or contexts. Users must navigate through predetermined interfaces rather than having experiences tailored to their specific goals and preferences.

### Solution Overview
Implement a modular composition system where:
- Agents dynamically create user interfaces from reusable components
- Users can modify their experience through natural language
- Components adapt and learn from user behavior
- All functionality remains accessible via conversation

### Success Criteria
- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in content interaction rates
- **Personalization**: 90% of users receive customized interface compositions
- **Conversation Usage**: 70% of users successfully modify their experience via chat
- **Developer Velocity**: 50% faster development of new UI features

## User Stories & Requirements

### Primary User Stories

#### Story 1: Adaptive Learning Interface
**As a** leadership coach
**I want** my learning dashboard to automatically prioritize content based on my progress and goals
**So that** I can focus on the most relevant materials without manual searching

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agent analyzes user progress and preferences
- Dashboard composition adapts to show priority content
- User can request interface changes via chat
- Changes persist across sessions

#### Story 2: Conversational Interface Customization
**As a** busy executive
**I want** to tell the system "show me only videos under 10 minutes"
**So that** my interface only displays content I have time to consume

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Natural language interface modification
- Real-time composition updates
- Filter preferences remembered
- Easy removal of custom filters

#### Story 3: Dynamic Component Discovery
**As a** new user
**I want** the system to introduce new features contextually through conversation
**So that** I can discover capabilities without overwhelming interfaces

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Agent suggests relevant components based on user behavior
- Components are introduced progressively
- User can ask "what else can I do here?"
- Help is always available through chat

### Technical Requirements

#### Core System Requirements
1. **Component Registry**: Central system for component discovery and management
2. **Schema Validation**: Runtime validation of all compositions
3. **Agent Integration**: Seamless connection between agents and component system
4. **Performance**: Composition rendering <100ms, agent discovery <50ms
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: Graceful handling of component version changes
