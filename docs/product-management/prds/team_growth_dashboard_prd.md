# Team Growth Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Team Growth Dashboard transforms traditional performance monitoring into a growth catalyst for LeaderForge teams. Built on the principle of "illusion of simplicity," it provides sophisticated AI-powered insights through an elegant, coaching-focused interface that helps team leaders become effective growth facilitators rather than performance monitors.

**Core Philosophy**: Help team members grow relative to their own baseline performance through supportive coaching, not competitive surveillance.

---

## Product Overview

### Vision Statement
Create a dashboard that empowers team leaders to identify growth opportunities, provide targeted support, and foster a culture of continuous improvement where team members thrive in their optimal challenge zone.

### Key Principles
- **Growth-Oriented**: Focus on personal development relative to individual baselines
- **Coaching-Focused**: Surface actionable insights for supportive conversations  
- **Kaizen Philosophy**: Reward effort and celebrate incremental improvement
- **Illusion of Simplicity**: Hide algorithmic complexity behind clean, intuitive UX
- **Anti-Surveillance**: Eliminate policing mindset in favor of empowerment

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Team Leaders (managing 2-10 direct reports)
- **Secondary**: Executive Dashboard users (managing multiple teams)
- **Tertiary**: Individual contributors (self-awareness of growth trajectory)

## Data Models & Calculations

### Challenge Level Algorithm
```
Challenge Score = Weighted Average of:
- Bold Action Complexity (40%): AI analysis of text content
- Completion Velocity (25%): Rate vs. personal baseline
- Impact Radius (20%): Estimated downstream effect
- Process Adherence (10%): Thin-slicing, timeline compliance
- Self-Assessment (5%): User-reported difficulty ratings

Zones:
- Under-challenged: <0.6 of personal baseline
- Optimal Zone: 0.6-0.9 of stretch capacity
- Over-stretched: >0.9 of maximum capacity
```

### Bold Action Weighting
```
Bold Action Score = (Challenge Factor × Impact Multiplier × Count) / Time Period

Challenge Factor: 1-10 (AI analysis)
Impact Multiplier: 
- Administrative (1x)
- Team Impact (2x) 
- Revenue Impact (3x)
- Cultural/Innovation (4x)

Red Flags:
- >3 active Bold Actions
- Any action >3 weeks duration
- Completion rate <70% over 30 days
```

### Points System Configuration
```
Base Points:
- Bold Action Completion: 20pts
- Video + Worksheet: 10pts  
- Administrative Task: 5pts
- Prompt Library Contribution: 50pts
- Prompt Refinement: 10pts

Multipliers:
- Streak bonuses: 1.1x for 7 days, 1.25x for 30 days
- Challenge bonus: +25% for above-baseline difficulty
- Impact bonus: +50% for high-impact actions
```
