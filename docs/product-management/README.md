## Product Vision

### Agent-Native Platform
LeaderForge is an AI-powered learning and development platform where:
- **Agents orchestrate everything** - AI agents handle all user interactions and workflows
- **Conversations drive experiences** - Users accomplish goals through natural language
- **Dynamic UI composition** - Agents compose interfaces based on user context and needs
- **Contextual intelligence** - Platform understands user progress, preferences, and goals

### User Experience Principles
1. **Conversation-First**: Every feature accessible via natural language interaction
2. **Context-Aware**: System remembers user state and adapts accordingly
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed as needed, not overwhelming
4. **Seamless Handoffs**: Smooth transitions between different agents and capabilities

### Target Outcomes
- **Increased Engagement**: Higher frequency of meaningful interactions
- **Better Learning Outcomes**: Measurable improvement in user skill development
- **Reduced Friction**: Simplified access to content and tools
- **Personalized Experience**: Tailored content and recommendations for each user

## Product Requirements Process

### PRD Creation Process
1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly define user problem and business opportunity
2. **User Research**: Validate problem with target users and stakeholders
3. **Solution Design**: Define solution approach and user experience
4. **Technical Feasibility**: Review with architecture team for implementation viability
5. **Success Metrics**: Define measurable success criteria and KPIs
6. **Create PRD**: Document using [PRD template](templates/prd-template.md)
7. **Stakeholder Review**: Get approval from relevant teams and leadership
8. **Architecture Planning**: Work with architects to create [ADRs](../architecture/adr/)

### Requirements Quality Standards
- **User-Focused**: Written from user perspective with clear value proposition
- **Measurable**: Include specific success metrics and acceptance criteria
- **Feasible**: Technically implementable within reasonable timeline
- **Complete**: Cover all functional and non-functional requirements
- **Testable**: Include clear testing scenarios and edge cases

### Stakeholder Involvement
- **Users**: Direct user feedback and validation throughout process
- **Engineering**: Technical feasibility and implementation planning
- **Design**: User experience design and interaction patterns
- **Architecture**: System design and integration considerations
- **QA**: Testing strategy and quality assurance planning

## Feature Prioritization

### Prioritization Framework
1. **User Impact**: How many users benefit and how significantly?
2. **Business Value**: Revenue impact, cost savings, strategic alignment
3. **Technical Effort**: Development complexity and resource requirements
4. **Risk Assessment**: Technical risk, market risk, operational risk
5. **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and downstream impacts

### Prioritization Matrix
- **High Impact, Low Effort**: Quick wins - immediate implementation
- **High Impact, High Effort**: Strategic investments - careful planning
- **Low Impact, Low Effort**: Fill-in work - implement when capacity available
- **Low Impact, High Effort**: Avoid - question whether needed

### Decision Criteria
- **Agent-Native Alignment**: Does it advance our agent-native vision?
- **User Experience**: Does it improve conversation-first interactions?
- **Platform Maturity**: Does it strengthen core platform capabilities?
- **Competitive Advantage**: Does it differentiate us in the market?

## Success Measurement

### Key Performance Indicators
- **User Engagement**: Daily/weekly active users, session duration, conversation frequency
- **Learning Outcomes**: Course completion rates, skill assessment improvements
- **Platform Performance**: Agent response times, UI composition speed, error rates
- **Business Metrics**: User retention, feature adoption, customer satisfaction

### Measurement Framework
- **Leading Indicators**: Early signals of feature success or failure
- **Lagging Indicators**: Long-term outcomes and business impact
- **Behavioral Metrics**: How users actually interact with features
- **Technical Metrics**: System performance and reliability measures

### Review Cycles
- **Weekly**: Review key metrics and immediate issues
- **Monthly**: Analyze feature performance and user feedback
- **Quarterly**: Assess overall product health and strategic alignment
- **Annual**: Comprehensive product review and strategy refresh
