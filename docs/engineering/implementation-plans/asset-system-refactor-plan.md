**Document Status:** üöÄ REVISED FOR AGGRESSIVE EXECUTION - ComponentSchemaRenderer Priority
**Purpose:** Comprehensive plan to evolve existing codebase to agent-native composition architecture
**Owner:** Engineering Team
**Tags:** #refactor #architecture #agent-native #implementation

## Senior Product Manager Review

**Reviewer:** Senior Product Manager
**Review Date:** Current
**Status:** REVIEWING - Edits Required

### Product Alignment Assessment
‚úÖ **Strategic Alignment:** Plan aligns with agent-native platform vision
‚ö†Ô∏è **User Value Delivery:** Timeline too backend-heavy, users see limited value until Phase 4
‚ö†Ô∏è **Market Timing:** 16-week timeline may miss competitive windows
‚úÖ **Business Impact:** Clear path to improved development velocity and user customization

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the complete transformation of the current monolithic component system into a modular, agent-native asset composition architecture. The refactor will be executed incrementally to maintain system stability while achieving architectural alignment with our established ADRs and design principles.

## Current State Analysis

### Technical Debt Identified
- **Monolithic ComponentSchemaRenderer** (963 lines) violates modularity principles
- **Mixed architectural patterns** across UI, API, and data layers
- **No agent discovery mechanism** for available UI assets
- **Hardcoded component relationships** preventing dynamic composition
- **Missing separation of concerns** between business logic and presentation

### System Dependencies
- Next.js App Router with existing routing structure
- Supabase SSR authentication pattern
- CopilotKit integration for conversational interface
- Existing database schema and API endpoints
- Current user state management and navigation

## Target Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
1. **Agent-Native Orchestration** - All business logic orchestrated by agents
2. **Schema-Driven UI** - Frontend renders based on agent-returned schemas only
3. **Modular Asset System** - Discoverable widgets, tools, and compositions
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between layers
5. **Incremental Migration** - Zero-downtime transition strategy

### Key Architecture Components
- **Asset Registries** - WidgetRegistry, ToolRegistry, CompositionRegistry
- **Unified Discovery Interface** - Single endpoint for agent asset discovery
- **Database-Backed Compositions** - Persistent user customizations with caching
- **Hybrid Communication** - HTTP for synchronous, BullMQ for async operations
- **Domain-Organized APIs** - `/db/`, `/integrations/`, `/assets/` structure

**Reviewer:** Senior Engineer
**Review Date:** Current
**Status:** REVIEWING - Implementation Feasibility Assessment

### Technical Implementation Analysis
‚úÖ **Cursor/LLM Acceleration:** 80-hour timeline realistic with AI-assisted development
üö® **CRITICAL RISK:** ComponentSchemaRenderer (963 lines) extraction extremely dangerous without comprehensive test coverage

‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling:** No comprehensive error handling strategy for asset composition failures
‚úÖ **Modular Design:** Package structure (`packages/asset-core/`) follows established patterns

### Development Workflow Assessment
‚ö†Ô∏è **Environment Setup:** No plan for local development environment changes (Redis, new packages)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Feature Flags:** Missing feature flag strategy for safe production rollout
‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Testing:** No load testing plan for asset discovery under concurrent usage
‚úÖ **CI/CD Integration:** Plan maintains existing deployment pipeline compatibility

### Senior Engineer Recommendations & Approval
