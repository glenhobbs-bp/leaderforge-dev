# Glen Hobbs - Personal Context

## Personal Information
**Name**: Glen Hobbs
**Role**: CTO (Fractional)
**Email**: glen@brilliantperspectives.com

## Key Responsibilities
- Ensuring stability of our systems
- Ensuring our systems and processes can scale orders of magnitude
- Mitigate technical and reputational risk
- Aligning cost to value of our technology along our growth curve (i.e. not investing ahead or behind)
- Realize the collective vision for the future through technology innovation
- Design to scale out "Beyond Brilliant" - establish our systems and methods with the intent that once proven within Brilliant, will scale out beyond (LeaderForge?)
- Equip and enable a team to perpetuate this role and responsibilities (risk management & succession planning)

## Company Information
**Companies**:
- Brilliant Book House (established 2007)
- Brilliant Perspectives, LLC (established 2012)
- Brilliant Movement (non-profit, 508 WA organization, established 2023)

## AI Usage Philosophy
- Scale the business with AI 'employees'
- Institutionalize knowledge and automate the application of it
- Shift AI from being the responder to prompts, to being the prompter for Humans-in-the-Loop ("PowerPrompts")

## Strengths
- Solving complex problems with technology
- Charting paths through ambiguity for others to follow
- Conceptual thinking and building frameworks
- Innovating - imagineering and architecting solutions that don't yet exist
- Easily energized and excited, like a 'dog with a bone' when focused
- 'Can do' attitude - known to say "how hard can this be?" and love learning

## Areas for Improvement
- Tendency to avoid confrontation
- Time management (the other side of the 'dog with a bone')
- Tendency to want to do things myself instead of delegate or buy back time
- Trusting to a fault (myself and others)
- Communication skills need improvement
- Tendency to press forward past the point I should have called it
- Not good at networking, marketing, social engagement

## Values & Motivations
**Loves**:
- Kingdom Solutions to Intractable Problems (KSIP) - Kingdom believers should be at the forefront of innovation, because "In Christ is hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge..." (Col 2:3)
- Being the head and not the tail (anticipating and preempting rather than reacting)
- 1:1 mentoring - helping unleash others' life purposes
- Nurturing shepherds, not sheep

**Dislikes**:
- Victim-mindedness
- Being told something can't be done
- Having to react or do damage control for something that could have been anticipated
