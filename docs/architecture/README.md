## Overview

This section contains all system architecture documentation including high-level overviews, detailed Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), design patterns, and integration guides.

## Structure

### üìã [Overview](overview/) - High-Level Architecture
Core architectural documentation and technology overviews:
- **[Agent-Native Composition Architecture](overview/agent-native-composition-architecture.md)** - Complete system overview
- **Technology Stack** - Languages, frameworks, and tools
- **System Context** - How LeaderForge fits into the larger ecosystem
- **Quality Attributes** - Performance, security, scalability requirements

### üìù [ADRs](adr/) - Architecture Decision Records
Complete record of all architectural decisions with context and rationale:
- **[ADR Index](adr/README.md)** - All decisions with status and relationships
- **[ADR Template](adr/adr-template.md)** - Standard template for new decisions
- **Current ADRs**: 7 foundational decisions covering core architecture

### üèóÔ∏è [Patterns](patterns/) - Reusable Architecture Patterns
Documented patterns for common architectural challenges:
- **Data Access Patterns** - Repository, unit of work, CQRS
- **Communication Patterns** - Event-driven, message queues, APIs
- **Security Patterns** - Authentication, authorization, encryption
- **Performance Patterns** - Caching, optimization, monitoring

### üîå [Integrations](integrations/) - External Service Integration
Documentation for all external service integrations:
- **Supabase** - Database, auth, storage integration
- **Tribe Social** - Content management and video platform
- **OpenAI/Anthropic** - AI model integrations
- **Third-Party Services** - Analytics, monitoring, etc.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Core System Design
1. **[Agent-Native Composition](adr/0001-agent-native-composition-system.md)** - AI agents compose UIs dynamically
2. **[Modular Monolith](adr/0002-modular-monolith-architecture.md)** - Single codebase with clear module boundaries
3. **[Separate Asset Registries](adr/0003-separate-asset-registries.md)** - Distinct registries for widgets and tools

### Data & Communication
4. **[Database-Backed Compositions](adr/0004-database-backed-compositions.md)** - PostgreSQL with Redis caching
5. **[Hybrid Communication](adr/0005-hybrid-communication-pattern.md)** - HTTP + message queue architecture
6. **[BullMQ Message Queue](adr/0006-bullmq-message-queue.md)** - Redis-based async processing

### API Design
7. **[API Route Organization](adr/0007-api-route-organization.md)** - Purpose-based route structure

## Architecture Principles

### Agent-Native Design
- **All business logic orchestrated by AI agents** - No hardcoded workflows
- **Schema-driven UI composition** - Agents define what UI renders
- **Conversation-first interaction** - Everything accessible via chat
- **Context-aware responses** - Agents understand user state and history

### Modular Monolith
- **Clear module boundaries** - Each module owns its data and logic
- **Event-driven communication** - Modules communicate via events
- **Shared infrastructure** - Common database, auth, monitoring
- **Independent deployment** - Modules can evolve independently

### Quality Attributes
- **Performance**: <100ms UI composition, <50ms asset discovery
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling of stateless components
- **Security**: Zero-trust architecture with comprehensive authorization
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and documentation

## Making Architecture Decisions

### Decision Process
1. **Identify Problem**: Clearly define the architectural challenge
2. **Research Options**: Gather at least 3 viable alternatives
3. **Analyze Trade-offs**: Document pros, cons, and implications
4. **Create ADR**: Use the [ADR template](adr/adr-template.md)
5. **Get Approval**: Follow [Senior Architect Rule](../governance/senior-architect-rule.md)
6. **Communicate**: Share decision with relevant teams
7. **Monitor**: Track implementation and impact

### Decision Criteria
- **Alignment**: Does it support our agent-native vision?
- **Scalability**: Can it handle our growth projections?
- **Maintainability**: Does it reduce or increase complexity?
- **Security**: Does it maintain our security posture?
- **Cost**: What are the financial implications?
- **Risk**: What could go wrong and how do we mitigate?

### Escalation
- **Technical Disputes**: Senior Architect makes final decision
- **Business Impact**: Escalate to product leadership
- **Security Concerns**: Include security team in review
- **Major Changes**: Architecture review board approval required

## Compliance & Reviews

### Documentation Requirements
- **All major decisions** must have ADRs
- **External integrations** must be documented
- **Security changes** require security impact assessment
- **Performance changes** require benchmarking

### Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Review pending ADRs and decisions
- **Quarterly**: Assess architecture health and tech debt
- **Semi-Annual**: Review architectural principles and patterns
- **Annual**: Comprehensive architecture assessment

### Quality Gates
- **Design Review**: All ADRs reviewed before implementation
- **Code Review**: Implementation checked against architecture
- **Security Review**: Security implications assessed
- **Performance Review**: Performance impact measured

## Getting Started

### For Architects
1. Review the [architectural overview](overview/agent-native-composition-architecture.md)
2. Read all current [ADRs](adr/README.md) to understand decisions
3. Familiarize yourself with [patterns](patterns/) and [integrations](integrations/)
4. Review the [Senior Architect Rule](../governance/senior-architect-rule.md)

### For Engineers
1. Understand the [modular monolith pattern](adr/0002-modular-monolith-architecture.md)
2. Review [API organization](adr/0007-api-route-organization.md) for endpoint creation
3. Check [integration guides](integrations/) for external services
4. Follow [patterns](patterns/) for common implementation challenges

### For Product Teams
1. Understand [agent-native principles](adr/0001-agent-native-composition-system.md)
2. Review [performance requirements](overview/agent-native-composition-architecture.md#performance-requirements)
3. Check [integration capabilities](integrations/) when planning features
4. Consider architecture implications in feature requirements

**Remember**: Architecture decisions have long-term impact. When in doubt, create an ADR and get appropriate review before proceeding.
