## 🏗️ **Agent-Native Architecture Compliance**

### **Agent Orchestration**
- [ ] All business logic orchestrated by agents, not hardcoded in UI/API
- [ ] No business rules embedded in frontend components
- [ ] API routes are thin - only invoke agents and return schemas
- [ ] Agent decisions drive all content composition and user flows
- [ ] Multi-step workflows handled by agent state management (LangGraph)

### **Schema-Driven UI**
- [ ] Frontend renders only what's described in agent schemas
- [ ] No hardcoded UI logic or business rules in components
- [ ] All dynamic content comes from agent responses
- [ ] UI components are generic and configurable via schema
- [ ] Theme and styling managed as configuration, not hardcoded

### **Tool Modularity**
- [ ] Tools are stateless, context-aware backend helpers
- [ ] No UI logic embedded in tools
- [ ] No cross-module dependencies in tools
- [ ] Tools are reusable across different agents
- [ ] Tool registry properly maintained and versioned

---

## 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**

### **SSR-First Authentication**
- [ ] All authentication uses server-side rendering patterns
- [ ] No client-side auth mixing with server-side patterns
- [ ] Consistent `createAuthenticatedSupabaseClient()` usage across services
- [ ] Session hydration follows standard cookie extraction pattern
- [ ] No mixed authentication approaches causing session mismatches

### **Entitlement Enforcement**
- [ ] All content access filtered by user entitlements
- [ ] Agents operate only within user's entitled scope
- [ ] No entitlement bypass in "quick fixes"
- [ ] Organization-level entitlements properly cascaded
- [ ] Entitlement caching strategy consistently applied

### **Security Patterns**
- [ ] No hardcoded user IDs or bypass mechanisms
- [ ] All database access goes through authenticated clients
- [ ] Service role usage limited to system operations only
- [ ] RLS policies enforced at database level
- [ ] No authentication tokens exposed to client-side

---

## 🎯 **Separation of Concerns**

### **API Route Purity**
- [ ] API routes contain no business logic
- [ ] Routes only: receive intent → invoke agent → return schema
- [ ] No database access in API route handlers
- [ ] No tool calls directly from API routes
- [ ] Error handling delegated to service layer

### **Service Layer Boundaries**
- [ ] Services handle single domain responsibility
- [ ] No cross-service direct database access
- [ ] Consistent authentication patterns across all services
- [ ] Service methods are pure functions where possible
- [ ] Inter-service communication through defined interfaces

### **Component Responsibilities**
- [ ] UI components purely presentational
- [ ] Business logic extracted to services/agents
- [ ] State management follows established patterns
- [ ] No API calls embedded in UI components
- [ ] Hooks handle data fetching, not business rules

---

## 📊 **Data Access Patterns**

### **Database Access Consistency**
- [ ] All data access through established service layer
- [ ] No direct Supabase client usage in components
- [ ] Repository pattern followed consistently
- [ ] No ORM bypass or ad-hoc queries
- [ ] Schema access properly validated (`core.`, `public.`)

### **Caching Strategy**
- [ ] Consistent caching patterns across services
- [ ] Cache invalidation properly handled
- [ ] No stale data served to users
- [ ] Performance-critical paths properly cached
- [ ] Cache keys follow naming conventions

---

## 🎨 **UI & Component Architecture**

### **Layout Consistency**
- [ ] NavPanel + ContentPanel layout pattern maintained
- [ ] CopilotKit integration uses pure API (no modifications)
- [ ] No custom layouts that break established patterns
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness follows design system
- [ ] Theme system consistently applied

### **Component Modularity**
- [ ] Components broken into composable parts
- [ ] No monolithic components exceeding complexity thresholds
- [ ] Component registry properly maintained
- [ ] Universal schema compliance across components
- [ ] No direct component imports (use registry)

### **Design System Adherence**
- [ ] Color palette consistently applied
- [ ] Typography hierarchy maintained
- [ ] Spacing system followed (Tailwind utilities)
- [ ] Animation/transition standards applied
- [ ] Accessibility standards met

---

## 🔄 **Agent-Native Composition**

### **Modular Monolith Structure**
- [ ] Components in registry, not microservices
- [ ] Agent-discoverable component system maintained
- [ ] No hardcoded component compositions
- [ ] Universal schema compliance enforced
- [ ] Component versioning strategy followed

### **Agent Communication**
- [ ] Agents use established communication patterns
- [ ] No direct agent-to-agent calls bypassing orchestration
- [ ] State management through LangGraph where appropriate
- [ ] Agent context properly scoped and managed
- [ ] Tool usage follows established patterns

---

## 📁 **File & Documentation Standards**

### **File Header Requirements**
- [ ] All files include standardized header comments
- [ ] Purpose, Owner, and Tags properly specified

---

## 🔍 **Observability & Debugging**

### **Logging Standards**
- [ ] Consistent logging patterns across services
