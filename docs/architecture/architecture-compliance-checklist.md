## üèóÔ∏è **Agent-Native Architecture Compliance**

### **Agent Orchestration**
- [ ] All business logic orchestrated by agents, not hardcoded in UI/API
- [ ] No business rules embedded in frontend components
- [ ] API routes are thin - only invoke agents and return schemas
- [ ] Agent decisions drive all content composition and user flows
- [ ] Multi-step workflows handled by agent state management (LangGraph)

### **Schema-Driven UI**
- [ ] Frontend renders only what's described in agent schemas
- [ ] No hardcoded UI logic or business rules in components
- [ ] All dynamic content comes from agent responses
- [ ] UI components are generic and configurable via schema
- [ ] Theme and styling managed as configuration, not hardcoded

### **Tool Modularity**
- [ ] Tools are stateless, context-aware backend helpers
- [ ] No UI logic embedded in tools
- [ ] No cross-module dependencies in tools
- [ ] Tools are reusable across different agents
- [ ] Tool registry properly maintained and versioned

---

## üîê **Authentication & Authorization**

### **SSR-First Authentication**
- [ ] All authentication uses server-side rendering patterns
- [ ] No client-side auth mixing with server-side patterns
- [ ] Consistent `createAuthenticatedSupabaseClient()` usage across services
- [ ] Session hydration follows standard cookie extraction pattern
- [ ] No mixed authentication approaches causing session mismatches

### **Entitlement Enforcement**
- [ ] All content access filtered by user entitlements
- [ ] Agents operate only within user's entitled scope
- [ ] No entitlement bypass in "quick fixes"
- [ ] Organization-level entitlements properly cascaded
- [ ] Entitlement caching strategy consistently applied

### **Security Patterns**
- [ ] No hardcoded user IDs or bypass mechanisms
- [ ] All database access goes through authenticated clients
- [ ] Service role usage limited to system operations only
- [ ] RLS policies enforced at database level
- [ ] No authentication tokens exposed to client-side

---

## üéØ **Separation of Concerns**

- [ ] Inter-service communication through defined interfaces

### **Component Responsibilities**
- [ ] UI components purely presentational
- [ ] Business logic extracted to services/agents
- [ ] State management follows established patterns
- [ ] No API calls embedded in UI components

- [ ] Schema transformation handled entirely by registry/dispatcher layer

### **Schema-Props Boundary Compliance (ADR-0009)**
- [ ] Widget schemas contain only agent-controllable properties

## üîß **Registry-Driven Development Workflow**

### **Adding New Widgets (Must Follow)**
1. **Widget Implementation** - Create widget component with proper TypeScript interfaces
2. **Registry Registration** - Add widget to WidgetRegistry with transformation functions
3. **Schema Definition** - Define Universal Widget Schema structure for the widget
4. **Testing** - Verify widget works through agent-generated schemas
5. **Documentation** - Update widget registry documentation

### **Forbidden Practices**
- ‚ùå **Never modify UniversalSchemaRenderer** for new widget types
- ‚ùå **Never add widget-specific imports** to universal components
- ‚ùå **Never hardcode widget logic** outside the registry
- ‚ùå **Never bypass schema transformation** layer
- ‚ùå **Never create widget-specific rendering paths** in universal components

### **Registry-First Principles**
- ‚úÖ **All widget discovery** happens through registry APIs
- ‚úÖ **All schema transformation** happens in registry layer
- ‚úÖ **All widget routing** happens through dispatcher pattern
- ‚úÖ **All new functionality** accessible immediately after registration
- ‚úÖ **All rendering logic** contained within individual widget components
