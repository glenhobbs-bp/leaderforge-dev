**File:** docs/architecture/adr/0004-database-backed-compositions.md
**Purpose:** Architecture Decision Record for storing user-customized compositions in database
**Owner:** Senior Architect
**Tags:** ADR, architecture, database, compositions, user-customization, caching

## Decision Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2024-01-15 |
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Decision Type** | Architecture |
| **Impact Level** | Medium |
| **Stakeholders** | Backend Team, Frontend Team, Product Team |
| **Supersedes** | N/A |

## Context

**Background:** Agent-native composition enables users to customize their interfaces through conversation ("show me only videos under 10 minutes", "pin this layout for leadership content"). These customizations need persistence across sessions and devices while maintaining fast loading performance.

**Problem Statement:** User composition storage needs to handle:
- User-specific interface customizations created through chat
- Pinned compositions that users want to reuse
- Shared compositions that teams or organizations want to standardize
- Fast loading of personalized interfaces on page load
- Synchronization across multiple devices/sessions

**Goals:**
- Persist user customizations permanently with full CRUD operations
- Support sharing compositions between users and organizations
- Enable fast page loads with personalized interfaces (<100ms composition loading)
- Provide offline capability for composition schemas
- Support composition versioning and rollback

**Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Composition loading performance must not impact page load times
- User privacy: compositions may contain sensitive layout preferences
- Storage efficiency: avoid duplicating identical compositions across users

## Decision

**Summary:** Store user compositions in PostgreSQL with Redis caching layer, supporting both personal and shared compositions with efficient schema storage.

**Details:**
- **Database Storage**: PostgreSQL tables for compositions, user_compositions, and shared_compositions
- **Caching Layer**: Redis cache for frequently accessed compositions and schemas
- **Schema Optimization**: JSON compression and deduplication for similar compositions
- **Access Control**: Row-level security for personal/organizational composition access
- **Offline Support**: Local storage cache with sync mechanism

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Database-Backed with Caching (Selected)
**Description:** PostgreSQL storage with Redis caching and local storage fallback

**Pros:**
- **Persistence**: Reliable storage with ACID transactions
- **Performance**: Redis caching for fast composition loading
- **Sharing**: Database enables composition sharing across users
- **Offline support**: Local storage provides offline access
- **Versioning**: Database supports composition history and rollback
- **Analytics**: Can track composition usage patterns

**Cons:**
- **Storage cost**: Database storage for potentially large JSON schemas
- **Cache complexity**: Cache invalidation and consistency management
- **Sync complexity**: Local storage sync with database state

**Risk Level:** Low

### Option 2: Client-Side Storage Only
**Description:** Store compositions in browser localStorage/IndexedDB only

**Pros:**
- **Performance**: Instant loading from local storage
- **Privacy**: No server-side storage of user preferences
- **Simplicity**: No database schema or caching complexity
- **Offline-first**: Works without network connection

**Cons:**
- **No sharing**: Cannot share compositions between users
- **Device-bound**: Compositions don't sync across devices
- **No backup**: Lost if user clears browser data
- **No analytics**: Cannot track usage patterns

**Risk Level:** Medium

### Option 3: File-Based Storage
**Description:** Store compositions as JSON files in cloud storage (S3/Supabase Storage)

**Pros:**
- **Cost efficiency**: Cheaper than database storage for large schemas
- **Scalability**: Can handle very large composition files
- **Versioning**: File versioning through cloud storage

**Cons:**
- **Query limitations**: Cannot efficiently query composition metadata
- **Performance**: File access slower than database queries
- **Consistency**: No transactional updates across multiple compositions
- **Access control**: More complex than database row-level security

**Risk Level:** High

## Decision Rationale

**Primary Factors:**
1. **User experience**: Cross-device synchronization essential for modern applications
2. **Sharing capabilities**: Teams need to share standardized interface layouts
3. **Performance requirements**: Caching enables fast loading while maintaining persistence
4. **Data integrity**: Database transactions ensure composition consistency

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- **Storage costs** for improved user experience and sharing capabilities
- **Implementation complexity** for robust feature set and future extensibility

**Assumptions:**
- Users will create multiple compositions and want them across devices
- Composition sharing will become important for team collaboration
- Caching can achieve target performance (<100ms loading)
- Database storage costs acceptable for user experience benefits

## Implementation Impact

### Technical Impact
- **Architecture Changes**: New composition storage layer with cache management
- **Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL tables, Redis cache, local storage backup
- **Data Migration**: N/A (new feature)
- **Performance**: <100ms composition loading with caching
- **Security Impact**: Row-level security for user/org composition access, schema validation

### Process Impact
- **Development Workflow**: Database migrations for composition schema changes
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for storage layer, integration tests for cache consistency
- **Deployment**: Database migration coordination, cache warming procedures
- **Monitoring**: Composition usage metrics, cache hit rates, loading performance

### Team Impact
- **Learning Curve**: Database design patterns, caching strategies
- **Training Needs**: Composition schema design, cache management best practices
- **Resource Requirements**: Backend developer familiar with PostgreSQL and Redis

## Success Criteria

**Technical Metrics:**
- Composition loading performance <100ms (95th percentile)
- Cache hit rate >90% for frequently accessed compositions
- 99.9% data consistency between cache and database
- Support for 1000+ compositions per user

**Business Metrics:**
- 80% of users create at least one custom composition
- 40% of users share compositions with team members
- 25% reduction in support requests about interface preferences
- 95% user satisfaction with composition sync across devices

**Timeline:**
- **Decision Implementation:** January 2024
- **Database Schema Design:** February 2024
- **Caching Layer Implementation:** March 2024
- **User Interface Integration:** April 2024

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **Risk:** Cache consistency issues causing user confusion
  - **Mitigation:** Cache invalidation strategies, consistency checks, fallback to database
  - **Contingency:** Simplified caching or cache-aside pattern

### Medium Risks
- **Risk:** Database storage costs exceed budget projections
  - **Mitigation:** Composition schema compression, usage monitoring, cost alerts
  - **Contingency:** Implement composition size limits or move to file storage

- **Risk:** Performance targets not met even with caching
  - **Mitigation:** Cache optimization, query optimization, composition schema optimization
  - **Contingency:** Pre-load popular compositions or reduce feature scope

### Low Risks
- **Risk:** Local storage sync complexity creates bugs
  - **Mitigation:** Robust sync algorithm, conflict resolution, user feedback
  - **Contingency:** Remove offline support or simplify sync logic
