| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Date** | 2024-01-15 |
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Decision Type** | Architecture |
| **Impact Level** | High |
| **Stakeholders** | All Engineering Teams, DevOps, Platform Team |
| **Supersedes** | N/A |

## Context

**Background:** As LeaderForge grows, we need an architecture that supports rapid feature development, maintains code organization, and scales with our team. The choice between microservices, traditional monolith, and modular monolith significantly impacts development velocity, operational complexity, and system maintainability.

**Problem Statement:** Current architecture decisions needed:
- How to organize code as team and features grow
- Balance between development velocity and operational complexity
- Support for agent-native composition while maintaining performance
- Clear boundaries between different platform capabilities (content, progress, agents, etc.)

**Goals:**
- Maximize development velocity for small-to-medium team (5-15 developers)
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between platform capabilities
- Support agent-native composition without service complexity
- Enable independent development of features without coordination overhead
- Minimize operational complexity and infrastructure costs

**Constraints:**
- Team size: 5-15 developers currently, growing to ~20-30 over next 2 years
- Budget limitations: Avoid premature infrastructure complexity
- Performance requirements: <100ms API responses, <2s page loads
- Deployment: Must support rapid iteration and feature flags

## Decision

**Summary:** Adopt a modular monolith architecture with clear module boundaries, shared database, and unified deployment while maintaining strict separation of concerns.

**Details:**
- **Single Codebase**: All code in monorepo with clear module boundaries
- **Module Independence**: Each module (agents, content, progress, auth) has own directory structure
- **Shared Database**: Single PostgreSQL instance with module-specific schemas
- **Unified Deployment**: Single application deployment with all modules
- **Clear Interfaces**: Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces only
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Inter-module communication via events, not direct calls

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Modular Monolith (Selected)
**Description:** Single deployable unit with clear internal module boundaries

**Pros:**
- **Development velocity**: No network calls, shared tooling, simple debugging
- **Operational simplicity**: Single deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure
- **Transaction consistency**: ACID transactions across modules when needed
- **Team productivity**: No service coordination, shared development environment
- **Cost efficiency**: Minimal infrastructure overhead

**Cons:**
- **Scaling limitations**: Cannot scale modules independently
- **Technology constraints**: All modules must use same tech stack
- **Potential coupling**: Risk of modules becoming tightly coupled over time
- **Deploy coordination**: All changes deploy together

**Risk Level:** Low

### Option 2: Microservices Architecture
**Description:** Each module as independent service with own database and deployment

**Pros:**
- **Independent scaling**: Scale each service based on demand
- **Technology diversity**: Different tech stacks per service
- **Team autonomy**: Teams can work completely independently
- **Fault isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't affect others

**Cons:**
- **Operational complexity**: Multiple deployments, monitoring, databases
- **Network overhead**: Inter-service communication latency
- **Data consistency**: Complex distributed transaction management
- **Development overhead**: Service coordination, API versioning
- **Team overhead**: Requires more senior developers

**Risk Level:** High

### Option 3: Traditional Monolith
**Description:** Single codebase without strict module boundaries

**Pros:**
- **Simplicity**: Easiest to understand and develop
- **Performance**: No module boundaries, direct function calls
- **Development speed**: No architectural constraints

**Cons:**
- **Code organization**: Becomes unmaintainable as codebase grows
- **Team conflicts**: Developers stepping on each other's code
- **Testing complexity**: Difficult to test features in isolation
- **Deployment risk**: Changes anywhere can break everything

**Risk Level:** Medium

## Decision Rationale

**Primary Factors:**
1. **Team size and experience**: Small team benefits from reduced operational complexity
2. **Development velocity**: Focus on features, not infrastructure coordination
3. **Cost efficiency**: Single infrastructure footprint vs multiple services
4. **Agent-native requirements**: Complex agent orchestration easier with shared memory

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- **Independent scaling** traded for development velocity and simplicity
- **Technology diversity** traded for team consistency and shared knowledge
- **Fault isolation** traded for operational simplicity

**Assumptions:**
- Team will remain <30 developers for next 2 years
- Performance requirements can be met with single deployment
- Clear module discipline can be maintained through architecture rules
- Future migration to microservices possible if needed

## Implementation Impact

### Technical Impact
- **Architecture Changes**: Organize codebase into clear modules with defined boundaries
- **Technology Stack**: Unified stack (Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Data Migration**: Design database schemas for module separation
- **Performance**: Excellent performance due to in-process communication
- **Security Impact**: Shared security context simplifies authentication/authorization

### Process Impact
- **Development Workflow**: Module-based development with clear ownership
- **Testing Strategy**: Module isolation testing, integration testing for cross-module features
- **Deployment**: Single deployment pipeline with feature flags for gradual rollouts
- **Monitoring**: Unified monitoring with module-specific metrics

### Team Impact
- **Learning Curve**: Minimal - standard web application patterns
- **Training Needs**: Module boundary discipline, event-driven communication patterns
- **Resource Requirements**: Standard full-stack developers, no microservices specialists needed

## Success Criteria

**Technical Metrics:**
- API response times <100ms (95th percentile)
- Page load times <2s (95th percentile)
- 99.9% uptime for single deployment
- Module coupling score <20% (measured by cross-module imports)

**Business Metrics:**
- 50% faster feature development vs microservices approach
- 75% lower infrastructure costs vs microservices
- 90% developer satisfaction with development experience
- Zero production issues due to service coordination

**Timeline:**
- **Decision Implementation:** January 2024
- **Module Structure:** February 2024
- **Migration Complete:** March 2024

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **Risk:** Modules become tightly coupled over time
  - **Mitigation:** Strict architecture rules, automated coupling detection, code reviews
  - **Contingency:** Refactor to microservices when coupling exceeds thresholds

### Medium Risks
- **Risk:** Performance bottlenecks as system grows
  - **Mitigation:** Performance monitoring, profiling, database optimization
  - **Contingency:** Extract high-load modules to separate services

- **Risk:** Team coordination issues as developers grow
  - **Mitigation:** Clear module ownership, communication protocols
  - **Contingency:** Split into multiple teams with service boundaries

### Low Risks
- **Risk:** Technology stack limitations
  - **Mitigation:** Choose flexible, proven technologies
  - **Contingency:** Gradual migration to different technologies
