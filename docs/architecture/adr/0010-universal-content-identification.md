| **Supersedes** | N/A |

## Context

**Background:** During system development, we discovered fundamental inconsistencies in content identification across multiple subsystems:
- **Navigation System**: Uses UUIDs for database operations, nav_key for routing
- **Video Progress System**: Uses content titles as identifiers (`"5.1 Deep Work Part 1"`)
- **Worksheet System**: Uses platform video IDs (`"leadership-fundamentals-01"`, `"2258888"`)
- **User Progress**: Mixed identifier usage causing data correlation failures

**Problem Statement:** Content identification architecture needed standardization across:
- Navigation options and routing
- Content items (videos, worksheets, articles)
- User progress tracking across all content types
- Form submissions and universal inputs
- Agent-based content delivery and orchestration
- Cross-system data correlation and analytics

**Real-World Impact:** Worksheet completion detection failing because video progress uses content titles while worksheet submissions use video IDs, preventing deterministic matching.

**Goals:**
- Establish universal content identification pattern across all systems
- Enable deterministic data correlation between progress, submissions, and content
- Support agent-native composition with stable, readable identifiers
- Maintain performance while enabling intuitive debugging and configuration
- Future-proof content identification for planned CMS implementation

**Constraints:**
- Must maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Performance must remain <50ms for lookups across all systems
- Must align with agent-native composition system requirements
- Must support multi-tenant content isolation
- Must work with future CMS and content management systems

## Decision

**Summary:** Use **UUIDs as primary deterministic identifiers** for all content and system operations, with **human-readable keys as secondary identifiers** for routing, configuration, debugging, and developer experience.

**Universal Pattern:**
- **Primary ID (UUID)**: System-wide unique identifier for all database operations, foreign keys, and data correlation
- **Human-Readable Key**: Stable, readable identifier for routing, configuration, debugging, and development
- **Display Name**: User-facing, localizable name that can change without system impact

**Application Across Systems:**

### 1. Navigation Options âœ… (Already Implemented)
- **Primary ID**: `id` (UUID) - database primary key
- **Human-Readable Key**: `nav_key` ("leadership-library", "brilliant-movement") - routing and configuration
- **Display Name**: `label` ("Leadership Library", "Movement & Mobility") - UI display

### 2. Content Items ðŸ”„ (Needs Implementation)
- **Primary ID**: `content_uuid` (UUID) - universal content identifier
- **Human-Readable Key**: `content_key` ("deep-work-part-1", "leadership-fundamentals-01") - stable reference
- **Display Name**: `title` ("5.1 Deep Work Part 1", "Leadership Fundamentals") - UI display

### 3. User Progress Tracking ðŸ”„ (Needs Refactoring)
- **Content Reference**: Use `content_uuid` instead of mixed title/video ID approaches
- **Progress ID**: `progress_uuid` for progress record identification
- **Deterministic Matching**: All progress types use same content identification

### 4. Worksheet & Form Submissions ðŸ”„ (Needs Refactoring)
- **Content Reference**: Use `content_uuid` for submission-to-content correlation
- **Source Context**: Include `content_uuid` in source context for deterministic matching
- **Submission ID**: `submission_uuid` for submission identification

### 5. Agent Content Delivery ðŸ”„ (Needs Implementation)
- **Agent Configuration**: Use human-readable keys for agent setup and debugging
- **Content Orchestration**: Use UUIDs for deterministic content assembly
- **Progress Enrichment**: Use UUIDs for accurate progress correlation

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Universal UUID + Human-Readable Pattern (Selected)
**Description:** Standardize UUID + human-readable key pattern across all content systems

**Pros:**
- **Deterministic Correlation**: UUIDs enable perfect data matching across systems
- **Developer Experience**: Human-readable keys for configuration and debugging
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for CMS and advanced content management
- **Agent-Native Ready**: Supports sophisticated agent composition and orchestration
- **Performance**: UUID-based joins and correlations are fastest
- **Stability**: Identifiers survive content migrations and system changes

**Cons:**
- **Migration Complexity**: Requires refactoring multiple systems simultaneously
- **Storage Overhead**: Dual identifier system requires additional storage
- **Learning Curve**: Teams must understand UUID vs human-readable usage patterns

**Risk Level:** Medium (due to migration scope)

### Option 2: Content Titles as Universal Identifiers
**Description:** Standardize on human-readable titles as primary identifiers

**Pros:**
- **Immediate Readability**: All identifiers are human-readable
- **Simple Migration**: Video progress system already uses this approach
- **No Dual System**: Single identifier approach

**Cons:**
- **Collision Risk**: Title changes break all references
- **Localization Problems**: Titles must be universal across languages
- **Performance Issues**: String-based joins slower than UUID joins
- **Content Evolution**: Can't change titles without breaking system references
- **Platform Agnostic Problems**: External video IDs don't map to titles cleanly

**Risk Level:** High (fragility and performance)

### Option 3: Platform Video IDs as Universal Standard
**Description:** Use external platform video IDs as system-wide identifiers

**Pros:**
- **External Alignment**: Maps directly to video platform identifiers
- **Worksheet System Compatible**: Current worksheet system uses this approach

**Cons:**
- **Platform Lock-in**: Tied to specific video platforms
- **Non-Video Content**: Doesn't work for articles, documents, assessments
- **Platform Changes**: External platforms can change ID formats
- **Multi-Platform**: Can't handle content across multiple platforms
- **Future CMS**: Won't work with internal content management

**Risk Level:** High (platform dependency and limited scope)

## Decision Rationale

**Primary Factors:**
1. **Data Integrity**: UUIDs provide deterministic correlation across all systems
2. **Agent Architecture**: Supports sophisticated agent-based content orchestration
3. **Future CMS**: Ready for planned internal content management system
4. **Performance**: UUID-based operations are fastest for database correlations
5. **Developer Experience**: Human-readable keys maintain debugging and configuration ease
6. **System Evolution**: Pattern supports content system growth and complexity

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- **Migration Complexity**: Accept significant migration effort for long-term architectural alignment
- **Dual Identifier Overhead**: Accept storage and complexity overhead for benefits
- **Learning Curve**: Accept team learning investment for improved system capability

**Critical Requirements:**
- **Worksheet Completion Fix**: Must solve immediate video progress vs worksheet correlation issue
- **Agent Performance**: Must support fast agent-based content assembly
- **Cross-System Analytics**: Must enable sophisticated progress and engagement analytics
