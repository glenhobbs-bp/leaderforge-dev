- **Best practices** and tips for effective usage
- **Troubleshooting** common issues
- **Examples** and real-world use cases

## Contributing to Help Documentation

When adding new help documentation:

1. **User-focused**: Write from the user's perspective, not the developer's
2. **Step-by-step**: Provide clear, sequential instructions
3. **Visual**: Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful
4. **Examples**: Use concrete examples and scenarios
5. **Searchable**: Use clear headings and keywords users might search for
