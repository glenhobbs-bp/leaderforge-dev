# Legacy Documentation Migration Summary

**File:** docs/legacy-migration-summary.md
**Purpose:** Summary of legacy documentation cleanup and archival
**Owner:** Senior Architect
**Tags:** migration, cleanup, legacy, archive
**Last Updated:** 2024-01-15

## Overview

Successfully moved all legacy and deprecated documentation to `.legacy/` directory, creating a clean organized documentation structure focused on current development needs.

## Migration Results

### ✅ **Files Moved to `.legacy/`**
- **23 individual files** moved from root docs/ directory
- **Entire dev-notes/ directory** archived (27+ files)
- **Project artifacts** archived (restructure plans, summaries)
- **Superseded documents** archived (old rules, how-tos, templates)

### ✅ **Clean Documentation Structure**
Final docs/ directory now contains only:
```
docs/
├── .legacy/              # Hidden legacy archive
├── README.md            # Main navigation
├── manifest.json        # Auto-generated manifest
├── manifest.md          # Human-readable manifest
├── governance/          # Cross-team rules and standards
├── architecture/        # System design and decisions
├── product-management/  # Strategy and requirements
├── engineering/        # Implementation and how-to guides
├── product-design/     # UX/UI design and patterns
└── quality-assurance/  # Testing and quality processes
```

### ✅ **Legacy Archive Organization**
- **README.md** explains archive purpose and contents
- **Clear mapping** of where content moved to in new structure
- **Usage guidelines** for when to reference vs. avoid legacy content
- **Historical context** preserved for future reference

## Benefits Achieved

### **Improved Findability**
- **50+ legacy files** no longer clutter main documentation
- **Logical organization** by team role and function
- **Clear navigation** through main README
- **Role-based** entry points for different team members

### **Reduced Confusion**
- **No duplicate content** competing for attention
- **Single source of truth** for each topic area
- **Current standards** clearly separated from historical artifacts
- **Deprecated terminology** contained in archive

### **Better Maintenance**
- **Clear ownership** of each documentation section
- **Focused content** relevant to current development
- **Easier updates** without navigating legacy files
- **Clean manifest** reflecting active documentation only

## What's in `.legacy/`

### **Major Categories Archived**
1. **Development Notes** - Entire dev-notes/ directory with 27+ files
2. **Project Artifacts** - Restructure plans and summaries
3. **Superseded Rules** - Old architect and product manager rules
4. **Individual Guides** - How-to files now organized in engineering/
5. **Architecture Docs** - Content now integrated into architecture/
6. **Templates** - File headers and templates now in governance/

### **Historical Value Preserved**
- **Decision history** for architectural evolution
- **Process development** showing how standards emerged
- **Content migration** tracking for validation
- **Team learning** artifacts and development notes

## Guidelines for Legacy Content

### **✅ Appropriate Use**
- Historical research and context
- Understanding architectural evolution
- Validating migration completeness
- Learning from past approaches

### **❌ Inappropriate Use**
- Current development guidance
- New team member training
- Active project planning
- Standards and governance

## Future Maintenance

### **Archive Policy**
- **No updates** to legacy content
- **Preservation** for historical reference
- **Clear separation** from active documentation
- **External archival** consideration after 2+ years

### **Quality Assurance**
- Regular validation that current docs are complete
- Monitoring for references to legacy content in new work
- Team education on using organized structure
- Link checking to ensure proper references

## Success Metrics

### **Immediate Outcomes**
- ✅ **Clean docs/** directory with logical organization
- ✅ **50+ files archived** without loss of historical value
- ✅ **Clear guidance** on legacy vs. current content usage
- ✅ **Improved navigation** through organized structure

### **Long-term Benefits**
- **Faster onboarding** for new team members
- **Reduced maintenance** burden on documentation
- **Improved compliance** with documentation standards
- **Better decision-making** with clear current guidance
