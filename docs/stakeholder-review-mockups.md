# üéØ Stakeholder Review: Leadership Development Mockups

**Purpose:** Comprehensive mockup system demonstrating LeaderForge's three key perspectives for stakeholder validation
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Date:** January 6, 2025

## Overview

Three interactive mockups demonstrate the complete LeaderForge experience across different organizational levels:

1. **üë§ Individual View** (Marcus Dashboard) - Personal leadership development
2. **üë• Team Leader View** - Team management and coaching perspective
3. **üè¢ Executive View** - Organizational leadership health and insights

## Access Instructions

### For Development Team
All mockups are immediately accessible in development mode:
```bash
cd leaderforge-dev
npm run dev
# All mockups show for all users in development
```

### For Production Stakeholder Review
Mockups can be enabled for specific users via environment variables:

```bash
# Enable all mockups for stakeholder review
ENABLE_MOCKUPS_FOR_ALL=true

# Or enable specific mockups
ENABLE_DASHBOARD_MOCKUP=true
ENABLE_TEAM_LEADER_MOCKUP=true
ENABLE_EXECUTIVE_MOCKUP=true
```

## Stakeholder Feedback Collection

### Built-in Feedback System ‚úÖ
Every mockup includes automated feedback collection:
- **Blue "Feedback" button** visible in development mockup banner
- **Rating system** (1-5 stars) with comment collection
- **Automatic logging** of user feedback for analysis
- **Context capture** (mockup name, user info, timestamp)

### Feedback Review Process
1. **Immediate:** Feedback logged to console during demo sessions
2. **Aggregated:** Feedback can be collected and analyzed across sessions
3. **Actionable:** Direct input for requirements gathering and design iteration

## Next Steps for Stakeholder Review

### Immediate Actions (Today)
- [x] ‚úÖ Create Individual mockup (Marcus Dashboard)
- [x] ‚úÖ Create Team Leader mockup
- [x] ‚úÖ Create Executive mockup
- [x] ‚úÖ Register all mockups in system
- [ ] üîÑ Create navigation entries for new mockups
- [ ] üîÑ Set up stakeholder access (user IDs or environment flags)

### Review Session Preparation (This Week)
- [ ] **Demo Environment:** Prepare demo instance with all mockups enabled
- [ ] **User Accounts:** Create stakeholder test accounts with appropriate access
- [ ] **Demo Script:** Prepare guided tour of all three perspectives
- [ ] **Feedback Collection:** Set up feedback aggregation and analysis process

### Post-Review Actions (Next Week)
- [ ] **Requirements Analysis:** Convert stakeholder feedback into feature requirements
- [ ] **Design Iteration:** Update mockups based on stakeholder input
- [ ] **Implementation Planning:** Prioritize real feature development based on validated mockups
- [ ] **Mockup Cleanup:** Remove or convert mockups after real implementation

## Demo Flow Recommendation

### Suggested Demo Sequence (15-20 minutes)
1. **Start with Individual View** (5 min)
   - Show personal progress tracking
   - Demonstrate content discovery
   - Highlight motivation features (leaderboard, streaks)

2. **Progress to Team Leader View** (5 min)
   - Show team oversight capabilities
   - Demonstrate member progress visibility
   - Highlight coaching intervention points

3. **Conclude with Executive View** (5 min)
